In one of my projects I came across an interesting problem with BigDecimal values. The project uses a persistence framework to persist Java objects into an Oracle 9i database with the Oracle JDBC driver 10.2.0.3.0. I could also reproduce this problem with Hibernate on a Microsoft SQL Express 2005 database using the Microsoft JDBC driver 1.2.

The problem was that sometimes when I tried to store objects containing BigDecimal values the following exception was thrown and the object could not be persisted:
<code>
[2008-01-02 23:02:36] [main] WARN org.hibernate.util.JDBCExceptionReporter - SQL Error: 8114, SQLState: S0005
[2008-01-02 23:02:36] [main] ERROR org.hibernate.util.JDBCExceptionReporter - Error converting data type nvarchar to decimal.</code>

Converting nvarchar to decimal? I am trying to insert a number into the database and the JDBC driver tells me he is not able to convert a nvarchar (text) to a decimal?

After doing some search I found out that this problem might have something to do with a change made in Java 5.0. I found <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080105011959/http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/01/31/java-5-bigdecimaltostring-and-oracle-10g-jdbc/">this blog post</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080105011959/http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t88158.html">this article</a> writing about similar errors. The implementation of <code>BigDecimal.toString()</code> changed in Java 5.0 and there is a new method <code>toPlainString()</code> doing what <code>toString()</code> did before.

The following code example
<pre id="Java">System.out.println(new Double(12500000).toString());
final BigDecimal value = new BigDecimal(new Double(12500000).toString());
System.out.println(value.toString());
System.out.println(new BigDecimal(value.toPlainString()).toString());</pre>
executed with Java 5.0 results in the following console output:

<code>1.25E7
1.25E+7
12500000</code>

Whereas executed with Java 1.4 it generates another output:

<code>1.25E7
12500000</code>

Some JDBC driver use the toString() method to get the value of a BigDecimal and if it has to many decimal positions you may run into this problem.

In my case the solution was to do all the calculations with <code>BigDecimal</code> values and given<code>MathContext</code> and <code>RoundingMode</code> instead of creating <code>BigDecimal</code> values out of Double values from calculations.
<pre id="Java">BigDecimal value = new BigDecimal("100");
BigDeciaml result = value.divide(new BigDecimal("3"), 2,
                      BigDecimal.ROUND_HALF_UP);</pre>
instead of
<pre id="Java">BigDeciaml result = new BigDecimal(100.0 / 3.0);</pre>
