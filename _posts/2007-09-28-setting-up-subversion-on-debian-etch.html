<p><img src="http://dertompson.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/svnlogo.png" class="alignright" alt="svn" />Yesterday I installed  subversion on a Debian server again and I had too look for some guidance in the web again. This time I decided to write it down for myself.</p>
<p>I installed the following packages with aptitude:</p>
<p><code>sudo aptitude install libapache2-svn subversion subversion-tools</code></p>
<p>Afterwards the needed modules were already enabled in my apache2 configuration &#8211; I looked in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ and saw dav.load, dav_svn.conf and dav_svn.load linked. All I had to do was to create a repository by using svnadmin:</p>
<p><code>sudo svnadmin create /var/lib/svn/main</code> (you may choose whatever directory you like)</p>
<p>and configure the access path in my apache2 configuration:<br />
<code><br />
&lt;Location /svn&gt;<br />
    DAV svn<br />
    SVNListParentPath on<br />
    SVNParentPath /var/lib/svn<br />
    AuthType Basic<br />
    AuthName "Subversion repositories"<br />
    AuthUserFile /var/www/.svnusers<br />
    Require valid-user<br />
&lt;/Location&gt;<br />
</code><br />
I created some users with <code>htpasswd</code> and wrote them to the configured file <code>/var/www/.svnusers</code>. After loading the apache2 configuration I was able to connect and use the repository. I made www-data (the user under which apache2 runs)  the owner of the repository and its files.</p>
<p>If you want more detailed configuration of access permissions have a look at the <code>AuthzSVNAccessFile</code> configuration directive.</p>
