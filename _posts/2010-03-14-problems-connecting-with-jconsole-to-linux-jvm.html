<p>Lately I had problems configuring the JMX remote management for tomcat servers running on Ubuntu linux servers. After configuring everything necessary like the com.sun.management.jmxremote JVM parameters and the password files I still got connection errors when trying to connect from my Windows system to the server via jconsole.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6209663">this bug entry</a> for the Sun Java VM with some interesting suggestions. In my case the problem was a wrong configuration of the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. The command <code>hostname -i</code> always resolved to the loopback device 127.0.0.1 &#8211; after adapting the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file so that <code>hostname -i</code> resolved the real IP address I was able to connect my jconsole.</p>
