<p>For me as developer that creates apps for the BlackBerry Java environment one of the best news of this years <a href="http://www.blackberrydevcon.com/">Devcon</a> was, that the Java development tools are  now available, as a first tech preview, for Mac OS X. I switched to Mac OS three months ago and the only reason for firing up the VM were the BlackBerry tools.</p>
<p>So I downloaded the tools when the were published and installed them. I was quite enthusiastic but my anticipations were not quite met. The current version only includes the OS6 library but our product <a href="http://timr.com">timr</a> needs to be released for OS5. The second drawback was that they just ported the rapc compiler but not the fledge simulator. The marketing statement on the BlackBerry site is:</p>
<blockquote><p>On device loading and debugging over USB. No BlackBerry Smartphone Simulator required</p></blockquote>
<p>Which means it is not possible to run it in the Simulator because there is no simulator. I hope they will port the simulator to Mac OS soon too otherwise the environment is not very useful.</p>
<p>The second thing they announced that I found very interesting was that they released their <a href="http://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks">WebWorks SDK on github</a> as an open source project. I like this decision a lot because I am a huge fan of open source and github &#8211; I hope I got the time to participate in this movement and a lot other developers will do so too.</p>
