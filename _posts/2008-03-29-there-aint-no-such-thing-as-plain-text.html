<p align="left">I am thinking of ordering some of them. Handling encodings is a very important part of programming and from my experience a lot of developers do not care enough about it. I encourage every developer to read <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">“The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)”</a> from Joel Spolsky. It describes the evolution of encodings in a very easy way.</p>
<p align="left">Some months ago <a href="http://dertompson.com/index.php/2007/01/29/encoding-filter-for-java-web-applications/">I wrote a post about how to deal with encodings when using Tomcat as web application container</a>.</p>
