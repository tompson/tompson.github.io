<p>Last week I tried to create GORM criteria that shows from which countries the addresses stored in a table were. The SQL for this would look something like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql">select c.code, count(*) from Address a left outer join Country c on a.country=c.id group by c.code</pre>
<p>Now I wanted to sort the results with the country the most addresses were from on top. This SQL would look like:</p>
<pre class="brush: sql">select c.code, count(*) as co from Address a left outer join Country c on a.country=c.id group by c.code order by co desc</pre>
<p>I had to add the &#8220;as co&#8221; alias to the count column to use it in the order command at the end of the SQL. How could this be done in a GORM criteria? The basic criteria with the result of the first SQL looked like:</p>
<pre class="brush: groovy">Address.createCriteria().list {
	country {
		projections {
			groupProperty('code')
			rowCount()
		}
	}
}</pre>
<p>The question was how to add the &#8220;as co&#8221; alias to the row count column? In the Hibernate the Projections allow that by using the <code>as</code> method but how to do that in the GORM criteria DSL? I turned out the following way:</p>
<pre class="brush: groovy">Address.createCriteria().list {
	country {
		projections {
			groupProperty('code')
			rowCount('co')
		}
	}
	order('co', 'desc')
}</pre>
<p>You can give the alias to the projection as an additional parameter (or as the only parameter in case of <code>rowCount</code>).</p>
